Looking at the 5 differences, let me categorize them:

1. Substantive/Conceptual Difference:
   Q2.1/Q1.2 Part 4: singular values/vectors vs eigenvalues/vectors

This is a conceptual difference - they're asking about related but technically different mathematical objects
Your answer would need to address different (though related) concepts

2. Implementation Differences (affect how you code):
   Q3.4/Q2.1.4: Different helper functions

PDF 1: Uses corner_detection (provided helper)
PDF 2: Uses cv2.FastFeatureDetector_create() (OpenCV directly)
This affects your implementation - you'd write different code

Q3.5/Q2.1.5: matplotlib.pyplot.bar vs matplotlib.pyplot.hist

Different plotting functions
This affects your implementation - different function calls with potentially different parameters

Q3.9/Q2.2.4: Warping function options

PDF 1: Two options (skimage OR OpenCV)
PDF 2: Only OpenCV
This affects your implementation choice - PDF 1 gives you more flexibility

3. Cosmetic/Variable Name Differences:
   Q3.8/Q2.2.3: Parameter names (x1, x2 vs locs1, locs2)

This is purely cosmetic - just different variable names
Functionally identical - both are NÃ—2 matrices of coordinates
Your implementation would be the same, just using different parameter names

Summary:
1 conceptual difference (eigenvalues vs singular values)
3 implementation differences (different functions/options to use)
1 purely cosmetic difference (just variable names)
So NO, these aren't just variable name differences - there are real substantive differences that would affect:

What you discuss in theory answers
What functions you call in your code
What options you have available

Bottom line: You need to follow PDF 1 (ICS 483, Fall 2025) specifications if that's your actual assignment, because the implementation details differ enough that following PDF 2 would give you incorrect code in several places.
